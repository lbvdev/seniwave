        <h3 class="mono">
            The name comes from “seni” (“contemporary art” in Indonesian) and “wave,” the energy of digital innovation. Our white and purple palette reflects our belief in clarity, optimism, and the real value technology brings.

            Real Story?
        </h2>
        <h3 class="mono">
            <b>SENI WAVE: Created for founders, by someone who’s been there.</b>
        </h3>
        <h3 class="mono">
            But the real story starts with our founder’s own experience: working as a product manager, navigating the maze of branding, web development, and setup—often piecing things together with freelancers. <br>We saw how first-time founders and business owners end up overwhelmed—forced to learn new skills, overpay for partial solutions, or settle for websites that can’t really grow with them. We believed there was a better way.
